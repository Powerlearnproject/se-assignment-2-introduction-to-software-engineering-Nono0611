# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: The branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): Software engineering is extended over the entire lifecycle of the software, from conception to maintenance, emphasizing a structured and methodical approach to software development, while programming is centered around the code

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: : Agile promotes ongoing collaboration, while Waterfall focuses on thorough planning and execution in predetermined

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering: Agile is suitable for projects requiring flexibility and constant requirements changes, such as software development, where customer feedback and engagement are critical. On the other hand, Waterfall is ideal for projects with well-defined stages and straightforward, linear requirements

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles: The process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements, it is to identify, analyse, document, and validate the needs of software users, providing a roadmap for the development team and ensuring everyone works towards a common goal 

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering: By reducing code complexity, and improve components' coherence and reusability by breaking the system into smaller, more manageable modules

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems: Aims to evaluate and improve the quality of software products

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management: Software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. Github , HelixCore, Beanstalk etc

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance: Overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects. Communication, Lack of accountability, Project management software

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering: Improving the software overall, correcting issues or bugs, to boost performance

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines: Unethical data collection, Algorithmic bias, Weak security ,Wrong Priorities and etc. Continuous education and training programs.
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
